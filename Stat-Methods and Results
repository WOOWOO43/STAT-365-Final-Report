The data collection took place in 2022 by Anderson Evans for his article on the website Rallyrd.com (Evans, 2022). Rally is an asset investment company which allows users to buy and sell equity shares in collectible assets. The data collection took place at the Rally company, looking at websites such as UncannyXMen.net and the Marvel Fandom Database. From the data collected there are only 26 X-men in this dataset, and in the context of this study they are the observational units, Inclusion and . A computer was used to collect the data, from looking on the internet, and including keywords in Ebay search such as included issue title, issue number, and “VG,” which indicates that the seller believed their comic book to be in “Very Good” condition. The original author did not state the criteria for variable exclusion, so it is unknown how observations were excluded.

The response variable that we are interested in testing is the total issues of X-men appearances, to see if the variables we choose below have an effect on an X-men’s total issues.
The variables we used were

TotalValue_heritage: The total value of each X-Men team member's issues as reflected by Heritage's highest sale, in dollars
TotalValue60s, TotalValue70s, TotalValue80s, TotalValue90s: The total values for each decade (60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s) from Heritage.
TotalValue_ebay60s, TotalValue_ebay70s, TotalValue_ebay80s, TotalValue_ebay90s: The total value of each X-Men team member's issues as reflected by Ebay's highest sale.
Members: The X-Men characters.
Total Issues: The total number of issues each character appeared in from the 60s to the 90s.
TotalValue, TotalValue60s, TotalValue70s, TotalValue80s, TotalValue90s: Combined values from Heritage and Ebay.
Sex: The X-men’s sex
Decade Introduced: The decade of an X-men’s first appearance





### Statistical Methods
To make the total value easier to understand we merged values from Heritage and Ebay to create TotalValue, along with TotalValue60s, TotalValue70s, TotalValue80s, TotalValue90s, and are using that instead of Heritage and Ebay separately. For the methods in this section the original dataset did not include sex, and decade introduced, our group had to manually add a characters sex based on a google search, and appending the sex using the tidyverse’s mutate feature. For the decade introduced, we mutated the appearance percentage by decade, and found the first instance of a character's appearance that was not zero percent, and assigned them the decade that corresponded to that non-zero percentage. 

We first wanted to test if sex had an effect on total issues. So we ran a two-sample t-test, with male as one group, and female as the other group. The two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the means of total issues between male and female characters. Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the mean number of total issues between male and female X-Men characters.  Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the mean number of total issues between male and female X-Men characters.


Furthermore the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression twice. The first time was to determine if there were significant differences in the total number of issues based on the decade a character was introduced. While the second time was with a total number of issues, based on the total value of the decade. Checking model assumptions for both models. it seems like all the FINE (Form, Independence, Normality, Equal Variance) to determine if appropriate assumptions are met: normality is good, equal variance seems okay, and independence is met through the assumption that the the values of the comics don't affect each other, but for context there is a light issue as the sample size is small, it is only 26 X-men.
